<p>Where were you when you learned that the McDonald's jingle "I'm lovin' it" was originally part of a full-fledged pop song by Justin Timberlake and Pharrell that flopped on the charts but found staying power as a slogan? For us, it was recording our live episode about sponsored content in pop back in March 2024, and we have not been the same since. Shaken by this revelation, we found ourselves asking, "What else don't we know about fast food jingles?"</p><p><br /></p><p>Turns out, it's a lot. From Taco Bell to Popeye's to Chili's, the music of fast food represent some of the most familiar melodies in society, across state lines and generations. But the stories behind those songs, and the way that fast food production and pop music production often move in parallel, was something we never saw coming once.</p><p><br /></p><p>Since we are music experts but amateur foodies, we invited the brilliant hosts of Eater's <em>Gastropod</em> podcast, Cynthia Graber and Nicola Twilley, to help serve up the history of fast food and its changing role in culture. Tune in and pig out with us as we listen and debate the artistic and ethical implications of the sounds of fast food. </p><p><br /></p><p><strong>More</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Check out more episodes of <a href="https://gastropod.com/">Gastropod</a></p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.
